# POWER-BI Dashboard
1. HR Analytics 

2. The dashboard provides a comprehensive view of employee data, with a specific focus on attrition trends over time. 
   It exists to help HR and management identify patterns, understand the causes of employee turnover, and make informed decisions to improve retention.

3. The dashboard was built using the following tools and technologies :
    • Power BI Desktop – Main data visualization platform used for report creation.
    • Power Query – Data transformation and cleaning layer for reshaping and preparing the data.
    • Data Modeling – Relationships established among tables (resorts, snow, and data_dictionary) to enable cross-filtering and aggregation.
    • File Format – .pbix for development and .png for dashboard previews.
